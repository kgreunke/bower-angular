# AngularJS

[Bower](https://github.com/twitter/bower) package for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/). This project _makes makes no modifications_ to the stock AngularJS build.

## Branches

The `master` branch does not contain any AngularJS distribution. Our [`stable`](https://github.com/PatternConsulting/bower-angular/tree/stable) and [`unstable`](https://github.com/PatternConsulting/bower-angular/tree/unstable) branches track with the respective AngularJS branches.

## Rationale

This is package is duplicative to [bower-angular](https://github.com/angular/bower-angular), but strives to maintain packages for both the stable and unstable AngularJS branches.
